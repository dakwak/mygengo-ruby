myGengo Ruby Library (for the [myGengo API](http://mygengo.com/))
========================================================================================================
Translating your tools and products helps people all over the world access them; this is, of course, a
somewhat tricky problem to solve. **[myGengo](http://mygengo.com/)** is a service that offers human-translation
(which is often a higher quality than machine translation), and an API to manage sending in work and watching
jobs. This is a ruby interface to make using the API simpler (some would say incredibly easy). 


Installation & Requirements

Installing myGengo is fairly simple:

    gem install mygengo-ruby


Tests - Running Them, etc
